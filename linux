This initiative focuses on modernizing our development and deployment ecosystem by:

Migrating the LSE and NGC clients to newer, scalable infrastructure aligned with current standards.

Transitioning all repositories from Bitbucket to GitHub, streamlining source control and enabling enhanced DevOps automation.

Standardizing CI/CD pipelines for both legacy and modernized clients.

Ensuring minimal downtime and thorough regression coverage during migration activities.

Key Goals:

Improve maintainability and performance of client platforms.

Enable seamless integration with our modern GitHub workflows.

Decommission redundant infrastructure.

Deliverables:

Fully migrated LSE & NGC codebases.

All active repos live and validated on GitHub.

Dev and QA workflows operational post-migration.
