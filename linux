Am I proactively identifying risks and dependencies early enough?

How effectively am I communicating with stakeholders and cross-functional teams?

🛠 Process & Efficiency
Are our release processes repeatable and scalable?

Where can automation further reduce manual intervention or error?

How can we reduce lead time from code commit to production?

✅ Quality & Governance
Are our quality gates (tests, scans, validations) catching issues early enough?

How are we ensuring security and compliance are embedded in the SDLC?

What patterns exist in our release issues, and how can we prevent them?

📈 Team & Collaboration
Is my team clear on ownership and responsibilities at each release phase?

What blockers are my team members facing regularly?

How can I better support my peers, QA, and DevOps counterparts?

🚀 Growth & Leadership
What leadership qualities should I strengthen for the next level?

How can I mentor or coach others in the release process?

What metrics should I use to demonstrate the value of release engineering?
